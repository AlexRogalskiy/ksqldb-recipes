1. Sign up for [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/), a fully-managed Apache Kafka service.

2. After you log in to Confluent Cloud, click on `Add cloud environment` and name the environment `learn-kafka`. Using a new environment keeps your learning resources separate from your other Confluent Cloud resources.

3. From the `Billing & payment` section in the Menu, apply the promo code `C50INTEG` to receive an additional $50 free usage on Confluent Cloud ([details](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer)).

4. Click on [LEARN](https://confluent.cloud/learn) and follow the instructions to launch a Kafka cluster and to enable Schema Registry.
