# Welcome to ksqlDB Recipes

These recipes highlight some of our most popular stream processing use cases with ksqlDB.
Each code example shows a ksqlDB query you can run to process real-time data streams, and connect to your production end systems, 100% in the cloud.

To try any of these out, make sure you first sign up for [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree) and provision a ksqlDB application.

# How to Run

Click in the left nav bar to view a recipe.
Each page explains the use case and how to deploy it in Confluent Cloud.

ksqlDB recipes can also run on Confluent Platform, but you'll first have to make appropriate modifications to the provided configuration files.
